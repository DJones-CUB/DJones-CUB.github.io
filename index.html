<!-- I want to be explicit: I do not like this lab because it relies on the student using generative AI to do much of the heavy lifting for them. 
    As such, I have chosen to neglect that part of the assignment. All code written in here, or in the style file, was either written by me or sourced otherwise from a human. 
    I have no intention of using generative LLMs in this class or any other circumstances. Blessed be the Omnissiah and let the cycle be discontinued. -->

            <p>Hey there, I'm Drake! I'm a computer science student at CU Boulder, going on the second half of my Sophomore year. I've been programming since I was a kid, starting with very basic batch programs and games, and I'm currently working on personal game projects of my own in concurrence with school. I'm a hobbyist fiction writer, miniature painter and worldbuilder. I enjoy horror movies, my favorite being John Carpenter's The Thing, and I'm quite fond of independently developed games.</p>
            <p>I'm from Wheat Ridge, Colorado, which is where I (still) currently live. My passion for programming and game development comes from my dad, a programmer who learned basic on a Commodore 64, who has encouraged me to continue on the path of programming- all of this is not to mention how much I enjoy games of all kinds- cards, board games, and video games especially, having been playing for as long as I can remember.</p>
            <p>Unlike many of my peers, I'm vehemently anti-AI, with my mom having been a traditional artist and myself a writer, and hope going forward to go into research for algorithms and programs to disrupt and harm LLM "trawling" through hostile image editing and other forms of encoding, such as the University of Chicago's <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html">Nightshade project</a>. I find the topic incredibly interesting and I personally believe that it may allow for enhanced cryptography that is virtually impossible for the human eye to recognize or the human mind to solve.</p>
            <p>I'm hoping to graduate from CU Boulder in 2028 and pursue my Masters degree at Boulder as well. Ultimately, I hope to use my skills and talent as a programmer to better the world by fighting against fascism, encouraging freedom of speech and expression, and creating art that disturbes the comfortable and comforts the disturbed.</p>
